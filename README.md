# test
automated

These automated checks perform an overall UI and functionality verification based on required test cases provided by QA lead.

Script is written by hand using Selenium WebDriver with some Junit and Java in Eclipse IDE, it should run properly when libraries and drivers are setup.

I am sorry I could not do it as requested, but Java is barely the most functional way I learned up until now how to use.

I wanted to create a C# replica, and realized in between that I could have done all of it using Selenium IDE.

But this is not an assessment of me using the Selenium IDE. It wouldn't have proven I could written all of the code by hand in C#.

I understand the concepts are the same yet the approach would be a bit different. I understand that, but I don't want to say I know how to use C#.

Please note that this script is by no means optimal.

Overall instructions:
Install Eclipse IDE, create a new project.
In lib file add to build path the required Selenium, Java and Junit JAR files. (Make sure Java SDK is set to PATH in system)
Download the appropriate Chrome Driver exe file.
Create a new package called com.docler.tests
Within the package create a Java class "Docler"
Get the Docler Java found in the github repository and Open/View Docler.java doc with an appropriate reader
Copy code into Eclipse IDE, modify any filepaths as required.
Run code.
